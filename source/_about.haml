        %p Hi! I&rsquo;m a bass player and composer located in Atlanta, GA. I'll play any music that feels good, but I really love to play Jazz and have been doing it professionally since 2007.
        %p I work as both a bandleader and a sideman,  playing original music and the classics of the Jazz tradition and Great American Songbook.
